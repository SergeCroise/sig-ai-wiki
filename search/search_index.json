The operating system provides a stable and reliable environment for running various AI frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, which can be used for developing machine learning and deep learning models.</p> <p>Rocky Linux also supports a wide range of programming languages, including Python, which is one of the most popular languages for AI development. Many AI libraries and frameworks are available for Python, making it an excellent choice for developing AI applications.</p> <p>Additionally, Rocky Linux supports containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes, which can be used for deploying and managing AI applications and services at scale. This makes it easier to build, package, and distribute AI applications and ensures that they can be run consistently across different environments.</p> <p>Overall, Rocky Linux provides a solid foundation for building and running AI applications and can be a good choice for developers and organizations looking for a stable and reliable platform for their AI workloads.</p>"},{"location":"community/","title":"Community","text":"<p>RockyAI has active communities at Rocky Linux Mattermost and Rocky Linux Forums</p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact US","text":"<p>Reach out to us for any talks related to running/publishing your application on RockyAI Ecosystem.
